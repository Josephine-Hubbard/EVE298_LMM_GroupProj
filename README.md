Group Project for EVE 298: Linear Mixed Modeling, Spring 2021

Authors: Josephine Hubbard, Jonathan Aguinaga, Summer Lauren Schlageter, Kirsten Sheehy

Question: What predicts an infants individual involvement in aggressive interactions? 
          How does aggressive behavior emerge as infants develop into juveniles and young adults? 
          Are there innate traits that predict the frequency of aggression given/received? Or does experience play a role?

Data:   SSD data from Josephine Hubbard/McCowan Lab
        Variables extracted are either individual traits of focal infant individuals (such as name, ID number, mothers name and ID,         sex, mother status (multiparous vs. pariparous), etc) OR it is frequencies of aggression collected using event sampling             (observing the entire enclosure/group). 

Goal:   Use linear mixed modeling to discern the influence of individual characteristics and experience on the expression of infant         aggressive behavior.
